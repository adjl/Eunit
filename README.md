# Eunit
Barebones unit testing framework for Euscheme

## Remarks
I started this as a simple exercise when I was working on [PolynomialArithmetic](https://github.com/adjl/PolynomialArithmetic). Before I realised it, I ended up with this thing. Huh. Nonetheless, the experience was very educational.

It seems hard-pressed to call it a 'framework', considering only `assert-equal` is implemented. But I think it is easy enough to extend with other assert statements.
